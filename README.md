<h1>DOT-Scraper</h1>

**Note:** This no longer works as DOT has implemented a max request limit.

<h2>Functionality</h2>

This is a simple script designed to run in the browser console alongside the DOT booking site. It requires you to be logged in and the tab to remain open.

There are two scripts:
*Scan and Submit* Scrapes and refreshes and books to the first test that fits the defined user parameters. 
*Scan And Send To DB* Scrapes refreshes and logs all results. It is designed to gather and plot data to predict the best time to book.

Both scripts are incomplete and have limited functionalityu after the DOT website change. The changes made by the DOT combat both simple scraping and excessive refreshing.
